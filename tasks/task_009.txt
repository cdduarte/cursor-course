# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement 'New Chat' functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Add the ability to start a fresh conversation while storing the previous chat in Supabase.
# Details:
Create a 'New Chat' button in the UI. Implement logic to save the current chat session before starting a new one. Develop functions to clear the conversation state and reset the interface. Update the database service to finalize the current chat session. Implement proper error handling for session transitions. Ensure the UI provides feedback during the transition process.

# Test Strategy:
Test creating new chat sessions from an existing conversation. Verify that the previous chat is correctly stored in the database. Check that the interface is properly reset for the new chat. Ensure error handling works correctly during the transition.
