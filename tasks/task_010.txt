# Task ID: 10
# Title: Add error handling, loading states, and UI polish
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance the application with comprehensive error handling, loading indicators, and final UI refinements.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application. Add loading indicators for API calls and database operations. Create error messages for common failure scenarios (API rate limits, network issues, etc.). Enhance the UI with subtle animations and transitions. Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes. Optimize performance by implementing proper React rendering strategies. Add final styling touches to match the clean, minimal design requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test error scenarios by simulating various failure conditions. Verify that loading states are displayed appropriately. Check the application on different devices and browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. Conduct a final review of the UI against the PRD requirements.
